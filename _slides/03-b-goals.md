## What this Course is About

- We need protocols!
- What is a protocol?
- Break into groups and try to communicate!

Note:
Re-order a message
Discard a message
Perturb the message or its check bits or numbering
Same for the return messages
Need acknowledgments, timeouts, sequence numbering, check bits, and a protocol
