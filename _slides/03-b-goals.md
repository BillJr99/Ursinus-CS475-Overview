## What this Course is About

- We need protocols!
- What is a protocol?
  - Can you think of some examples?
- We will have a class exercise in which we develop a protocol to communicate.

<!-- asides: They'll be hidden in your presentation, but you can see them if you open the speaker notes window (hit 's' on your keyboard).

<aside markdown="1" class="notes">
First:
Everyone try to speak at once - how to avoid collisions?
What do we do when a collision occurs?
Why can't we talk to each other to coordinate?

Second:
Communicate between two groups with a message over an unreliable channel
Re-order a message
Discard a message
Perturb the message or its check bits or numbering
Same for the return messages
Need acknowledgments, timeouts, sequence numbering, check bits, and a protocol
