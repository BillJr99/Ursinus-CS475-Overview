## What this Course is About

- We need protocols!
- What is a protocol?
  - Can you think of some examples?
- We will have a class exercise in which we develop a protocol to communicate.

<!--
Everyone try to speak at once - how to avoid collisions?
What do we do when a collision occurs?
Why can't we talk to each other to coordinate?
-->

<!--
Re-order a message
Discard a message
Perturb the message or its check bits or numbering
Same for the return messages
Need acknowledgments, timeouts, sequence numbering, check bits, and a protocol
